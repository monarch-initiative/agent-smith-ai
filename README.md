# Agent Smith (AI)

Agent smith makes it easy to instantiate AI agents that can safely and easily call APIs and locally defined functions to interact with the world. It is currently designed to use OpenAI's [function-calling models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) and thus requires an OpenAI API key.

## Basic Usage

Primary functionality is provided by a `agent_smith_ai.utility_agent.UtilityAgent` class, which yields `Message` objects in response to user questions. They also manage internal state chat, including the system prompt, chat history, token usage, and auto-summarization when the conversation length nears the context length. Finally, using OpenAI's [function-calling models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling), they can register endpoints of REST API's, and locally defined
methods as callable functions.

Here's some code from the basic example in `examples/monarch_basic.py`, which makes calls to a [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org) API. We start by using `dotenv` to read a `.env` file defining our `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable 
if present (we just need some way to access the key). We inherit from the `UtilityAgent` class, defining a name and system
message for the agent. 

```python
from agent_smith_ai.utility_agent import UtilityAgent

import textwrap
import os
from typing import Any, Dict

# load environment variables from .env file
import dotenv
dotenv.load_dotenv()

## A UtilityAgent can call API endpoints and local methods
class MonarchAgent(UtilityAgent):

    def __init__(self, name):
        
        ## define a system message
        system_message = textwrap.dedent(f"""
            You are the Monarch Assistant, an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about data from the Monarch Initiative knowledge graph. 
            You can search for entities such as genes, diseases, and phenotypes by name to get the associated ontology identifier. 
            You can retrieve associations between entities via their identifiers. 
            Users may use synonyms such as 'illness' or 'symptom'. Do not assume the user is familiar with biomedical terminology. 
            Always add additional information such as lay descriptions of phenotypes. 
            If the user changes the show function call setting, do not make any further function calls immediately.
            IMPORTANT: Include markdown-formatted links to the Monarch Initiative for all results using the templates provided by function call responses.'.
            """).strip()
```

Next in the constructor, we call the parent constructor which defines various agent properties. 

```python
        super().__init__(name,                                             # Name of the agent
                         system_message,                                   # Openai system message
                         model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",                     # Openai model name
                         openai_api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],    # API key; will default to OPENAI_API_KEY env variable
                         auto_summarize_buffer_tokens = 500,               # Summarize and clear the history when fewer than this many tokens remains in the context window. Checked prior to each message sent to the model.
                         summarize_quietly = False,                        # If True, do not alert the user when a summarization occurs
                         max_tokens = None,                                # maximum number of tokens this agent can bank (default: None, no limit)
                         token_refill_rate = 10000.0 / 3600.0)             # number of tokens to add to the bank per second
```

Still in the constructor, we can register some API endpoints for the agent to call. It is possible to register multiple
APIs.

```python
        ## register some API endpoints (inherited from UtilityAgent)
        ## the openapi.json spec must be available at the spec_url:
        ##    callable endpoints must have a "description" and "operationId"
        ##    params can be in body or query, but must be fully specified
        self.register_api("monarch",  # brief alphanumeric ID, used internally
                          spec_url = "https://oai-monarch-plugin.monarchinitiative.org/openapi.json", 
                          base_url = "https://oai-monarch-plugin.monarchinitiative.org",
                          callable_endpoints = ['search_entity', 
                                                'get_disease_gene_associations', 
                                                'get_disease_phenotype_associations', 
                                                'get_gene_disease_associations', 
                                                'get_gene_phenotype_associations', 
                                                'get_phenotype_gene_associations', 
                                                'get_phenotype_disease_associations'])
```

Finally, the constructor is also where we register methods that the agent can call. Agent-callable methods are defined 
like normal, but to be properly callable they should be type-annotated and documented with docstrings
parsable by [docstring-parser](https://pypi.org/project/docstring-parser/). 

```python
        ## the agent can also call local methods, but we have to register them
        self.register_callable_methods(['compute_entropy'])

    ## Callable methods should be type-annotated and well-documented with docstrings parsable by the docstring_parser library
    def compute_entropy(self, items: Dict[Any, int]) -> float:
        """Compute the information entropy of a given set of item counts.
        
        Args:
            items (str): A dictionary of items and their counts.
            
        Returns:
            The information entropy of the item counts.
        """
        from math import log2
        
        total = sum(items.values())
        return -sum([count / total * log2(count / total) for count in items.values()])
```

The above will allow the model to accurately answer questions like `"What is the entropy of the tile counts in a standard Scrabble set?"`! 

To use the agent, we first instantiate it and define a question to ask. The agent's `.new_chat()` method takes the
question and yields a stream of `Message` objects. It may yield multiple message objects if the agent decides
to call a function to answer the question. The first yielded Message will have `is_function_call` set to `True` and
information about the function call in other fields. The second message will be the result of the function call
in `content` and `role` set to `"function"`; this is sent back to the model, resulting in a third message yielded with the
models' response in `content` and `role` set to `"assistant`. It may be that the model's immediate response is *another* function
call, in which case function calls and results will continue to be yielded. It is also possible to yield the system message to the
stream with `yield_system_message` and the question itself with `yield_prompt_message` prior to the main message stream.

Messages are `pydantic` models, so `message.model_dump()` converts each message to a dictionary.

```python

agent = MonarchAgent("Monarch Assistant")
question = "What genes are associated with Cystic Fibrosis?"

## agent.new_chat(question) may result in a series of Message objects (which may consist of a series of function-call messages,
## function-call responses, and other messages)
## by default, the system message and initial prompt question are not included in the output, but can be
for message in agent.new_chat(question, yield_system_message = True, yield_prompt_message = True, author = "User"):
    ## each Message object as the following attributes and defaults:
        # role: str                                         // required, either "user", "assistant", or "function" (as used by OpenAI API)
        # author: str = None                                // the name of the author of the message
        # intended_recipient: str = None                    // the name of the intended recipient of the message
        # is_function_call: bool = False                    // whether the message represents the model attemtpting to make a function call
        # content: Optional[str] = None                     // the content of the message (as used by OpenAI API)
        # func_name: Optional[str] = None                   // the function name the model is trying to call (if is_function_call is True)
        # func_arguments: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None   // the function arguments the model is trying to pass (if is_function_call is True)
        # finish_reason: Optional[str] = None               // (as used by the OpenAI API, largely ignorable)

    ## the author and intended_recipient may be useful for multi-agent conversions or logging, they will typically be filled 
    ## with agent names, "User", or the agent name and the function it is trying to call
    print("\n\n", message.model_dump())
```

Once a chat has been initialized this way, it can be continued with `.continue_chat()` which operates in a similar way:

```python
## agent.continue_chat(question) works just like .new_chat(), but doesn't allow including the system message
question_followup = "What other diseases are associated with the first one you listed?"
for message in agent.continue_chat(question_followup, yield_prompt_message = True, author = "User"):
    print("\n\n", message.model_dump())

question_followup = "What is the entropy of a standard tile set in Scrabble?"
for message in agent.continue_chat(question_followup, yield_prompt_message = True, author = "User"):
    print("\n\n", message.model_dump())
```


## Additional Experiments and Examples

These are not complete and may be moved, but the following are currently included here:

**agent_smith_ai.CLIAgent**: A basic command-line agent with some formatting and markdown rendering provided by `rich`. May be inhereted in the same way as `UtilityAgent` for added functionality.

**agent_smith_ai.streamlit_server**: Serves UtilityAgent-based agents to a Streamlit-based frontend. See `examples/streamlit_app.py` for usage.

**agent_smith_ai/bash_agent/main.py**: Early version of a command-line-based AI assistant that can write and execute (after confirmation) complex commands.


Here's an example conversation from the `examples/monarch_cli.py` which uses the `CLIAgent`

│ The CFTR gene, also known as the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene, is    │
│ associated with several diseases. Here are some of the diseases associated with the CFTR gene:   │
│                                                                                                  │
│  1 Cystic Fibrosis: The CFTR gene is causally associated with Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic         │
│    disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus          │
│    secretions with an abnormal viscosity. More information                                       │
│  2 Congenital Bilateral Aplasia of Vas Deferens from CFTR Mutation: Mutations in the CFTR gene   │
│    can lead to the congenital absence of the vas deferens, which can cause infertility in males. │
│    More information                                                                              │
│  3 Hereditary Chronic Pancreatitis: The CFTR gene is correlated with hereditary chronic          │
│    pancreatitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas that persists over    │
│    time. More information                                                                        │
│  4 Bronchiectasis with or without Elevated Sweat Chloride 1: Mutations in the CFTR gene can also │
│    be correlated with bronchiectasis, a condition characterized by the abnormal widening of the  │
│    bronchial tubes. More information                                                             │
│                                                                                                  │
│ Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of diseases associated with the CFTR gene. The   │
│ CFTR gene plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, and mutations in this gene    │
│ can have diverse effects on different organ systems.                                             │
